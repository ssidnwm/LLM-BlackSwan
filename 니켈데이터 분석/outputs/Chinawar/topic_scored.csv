Specifically, China and India were reported to be purchasing cheap Russian oil, thereby aiding Russia in mitigating the impact of Western sanctions imposed in response to its military actions in Ukraine. This development underscores the growing economic ties and strategic cooperation between China, India, and Russia, as both Asian nations seek to capitalize on lower energy prices while effectively circumventing sanctions from European Union nations.",5,"The event indicates that China is actively engaging in economic cooperation with Russia, which may lead to increased demand for nickel as both countries strengthen their ties and trade relationships. However, the direct impact on nickel prices is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the event primarily revolves around oil purchases rather than nickel itself. The overall effect on global nickel demand is likely to be moderate, as the focus is on energy rather than commodities like nickel. Therefore, the impact is positive but not overwhelmingly so.

Donald Trump's plan to impose 10% tariff on China has $64 bn import hole,2024. 12. 6.,President-elect Donald Trump has promised to impose 10 per cent tariffs on all imports from China as soon as he takes office next month.,"On December 6, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced a plan to impose a 10% tariff on all imports from China, which could create a significant $64 billion import deficit. This move is seen as part of broader trade tensions and conflicts between the United States and China, highlighting ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic disputes between the two major powers.",-5,"The announcement of a 10% tariff on all imports from China by President-elect Donald Trump is likely to exacerbate existing trade tensions, potentially leading to reduced Chinese demand for nickel as the cost of imports rises. This could negatively impact global nickel prices due to decreased consumption from one of the largest consumers. However, the overall impact may be moderated by the availability of nickel from other countries, which could offset some of the demand loss. Therefore, the event has a significant but not extreme negative impact on nickel prices.

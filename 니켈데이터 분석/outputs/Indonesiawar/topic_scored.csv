The Indonesian government deployed thousands of troops in an effort to control the situation and suppress the ongoing violence that has characterized the decades-long struggle in West Papua, which has drawn little international attention.",-2,"The escalation of military presence in West Papua could disrupt nickel mining operations in the region, potentially leading to reduced production and exports.

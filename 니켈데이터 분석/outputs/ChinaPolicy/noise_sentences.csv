"The reduction of tax rebates for lithium battery exports and the cancellation of tax incentives on copper exports may lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of Chinese battery exports. This could result in a lower demand for nickel, which is a critical component in battery production. As China is a major consumer of nickel, this policy shift could negatively impact global nickel demand and prices. However, the overall impact may be moderated by the potential for other countries to fill the supply gap or adjust their production strategies. Therefore, the impact is significant but not as severe as direct sanctions or tariffs affecting nickel supply chains.

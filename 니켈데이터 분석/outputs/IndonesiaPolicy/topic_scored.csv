Initially, this policy was expected to pose challenges for miners, including veteran Norm Seckold. The summary indicates that this ban had far-reaching implications for the nickel industry, shaping the fortunes of those involved in mining and altering the market dynamics in Indonesia.",8,"The 2014 ban on the export of unprocessed nickel ores significantly impacted the supply side of the nickel market by restricting exports and encouraging domestic processing. This policy has led to increased investment in nickel processing facilities within Indonesia, which can enhance the country's position as a key player in the global nickel market. The long-term implications of this ban have likely contributed to a tighter global supply of nickel, thereby supporting higher prices. Given the historical significance and ongoing effects of this regulation, it warrants a positive score.
